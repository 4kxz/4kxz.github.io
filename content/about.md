Hi, I'm **Carlos**, a senior software engineer based in Barcelona. With over a decade in software development, I've worked on things you wouldn't believe. High-performance APIs, distributed systems, cloud infrastructure. I focus on Python and modern cloud technologies. I'm interested in API design and architecture, optimization and scaling.

I write about programming, databases, Linux, game development â€“ not because I'm particularly fond of writing, but because the process helps me understand topics better and I can reference them later. I've made some of these notes public in case they might help other developers who stumble upon them.

When I'm not coding, you can find me experimenting with personal projects or contributing to technical discussions. I work remotely and collaborate with teams across different time zones, bringing a structured yet flexible approach to software development.

Feel free to reach out through [email](mailto:carlos@garciamarquez.dev), or find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/carlosgarciamarquez/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/4kxz).
