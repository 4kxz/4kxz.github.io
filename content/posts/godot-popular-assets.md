Since the asset library only sorts by date, I made a script to sort all the assets by GitHub stars to see which ones are the most popular.

I've put the full list in [a spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13HBgtBQA-bFY6LULtjJ87fuNjOiZe3DFezWgQtl5RyI/edit?usp=sharing), but here's a quick overview of the top 10:
