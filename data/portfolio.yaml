          A movie recommendation app with a twist: instead of typical star ratings, you organize movies into tier lists (S/A/B/C/D) through drag-and-drop. As you rank movies, the app learns your preferences to suggest new ones.

          Built with React and TypeScript on the frontend, Python and ChatGPT API on the backend. Features a responsive UI with dark mode support and smooth drag-and-drop using the DND Kit library.
